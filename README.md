What is this project?
---------------------

This is a simple, UDP-based, server-client, turn-by-turn, attack-trading fight simulator written for a final project in an English class.
It's a toy project and the product of a few minutes of work and should be judged as such. :)

How do I build it?
------------------
```javac ./*.java```
